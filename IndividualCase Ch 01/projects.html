      <p>I have a ton of crochet books and randomly choose what to make. What better way of memorializing what I make than by putting a Project history together! Keeping a record of what you've made can help you apply for Tester's Calls. If you aren't interested in making your own patterns but would like to review patters, Tester's Calls are for you!</p>
